The sound of summer
is so sweet -- 
The sound of possibility 
of worlds just beyond the backyard
of worlds universes away
of leaves swaying gently in the wind
and whispering to you all of their secrets.

Tantalizingly short, 
every day the sun makes love with the leaves
and the ocean
dappling the earth with a splendour of dresses 
a warm, blissful, seductive embrace.

The sound of summer -- 
is the sound of possibility
worlds hovering in the air like soap bubbles,
delicately approached only by the lazy.
When all life slows and stands still,
is it only ever more sweet.
